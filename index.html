                <p>
                    This visualization is a line chart that displays trends in asylum seekers in three West African
                    countries Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea over the years 2000 to 2016. The horizontal axis
                    represents the years, while the vertical axis shows the number of asylum seekers. Each line
                    corresponds to a specific country: red for Liberia, beige/green for Sierra Leone, and blue for
                    Guinea. Key events are annotated on the chart to highlight their potential impact on asylum
                    seeker trends, such as the Civil War in Sierra Leone, elections in Guinea, and the West African
                    Ebola epidemic. These events align with noticeable peaks or changes in the trend

                <h3>Analyzing</h3>
                <p>
                    By exploring the chart, we observed that the number of asylum seekers from Sierra Leone peaked
                    around 2002 during the Civil War and declined steadily afterward. Guinea saw a dramatic
                    increase in asylum seekers after 2010, coinciding with the re-election of Alpha Condé and
                    further exacerbated by the West African Ebola epidemic. Liberia's numbers remained relatively
                    stable, with minor fluctuations. This analysis highlights how political instability, conflict, and
                    health crises significantly influence asylum-seeking patterns.

                    You can hover over the lines to view precise values and additional details for a specific year.
                    Tooltips display the exact number of asylum seekers for each country and event descriptions at
                    particular points. This interactivity allows for closer inspection of the data at critical moments,
                    such as peaks or transitions.
